## Further Improvements
If afforded the opportunity of more time, I intend to do the following;

1) Migrate the styling of the app from tailwindcss ( which I used due to time constraint ) to styled-system which is being used here.


2) Improve the overall design of the user interface as the current look could probably still use some improvement.


3) I also intend to add more tests to the application as I currently have unit tests for all the components, I intend setting up integration tests and other tests as well.


4) Setup a good CI/CD pipeline for the project for easier continous development process
