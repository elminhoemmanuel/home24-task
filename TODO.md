## Further Improvements
If afforded the opportunity of more time, I intend to do the following;
1) Migrate the styling of the app from using CSS modules to styled-system ( powered by emotion ) as I have come to discover it is a good styling alternative.
2) Improve the overall design of the user interface as the current look doesnt yet show my design sills as I have soley focused on refactoring the code so far.
3) I also intend to add unit tests for each of the components using Jest and react testing Library, as well as integration tests etc. using relevant technologies.
