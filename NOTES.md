## Important Notes 
1) I have been able to succesfully refactor the code from a class component to a functional component using modern javascript ( ES6 syntax ) and React hooks.
2) I have also ensured that I refactored the code to be more modular breaking the various parts of the UI into smaller seperate components.
3) I have also made the CSS modular , utilizing CSS modules for each of the components.
4) I have utilized a better and more current library for fetching API data ( axios ) as opposed to the a little bit old syntax of xhr used initially.
5) So far I have mainly been able to refactor the code to use the modern techniques used in React and Javascript and have not been able to really demonstrate my CSS and design skills by improving the overall design of the app.
