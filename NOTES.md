## Important Notes 
1) I have been able to succesfully refactor the code from a class component to a functional component using modern javascript ( ES6 syntax ) and React hooks.


2) I have also ensured that I refactored the code to be more modular breaking the various parts of the UI into smaller seperate components.


3) I made use of tailwindcss for styling the application mainly due to time constraint because although I do know how to use styled-system ( and styled-components ) I was having errors setting up styled-system and time was running out hence my decision to use tailwindcss. Using tailwindcss enabled me to move fast and finish in time but i do know how to build using styled-system which is being used here. I am open to redoing this using styled-system if need be, if I can be afforded more time
   
4) I have utilized a better and more modern library for fetching API data ( axios ) as opposed to the a little bit old syntax of xhr used initially.


5) So far I have mainly been able to refactor the code, improve the styling and setup unit test cases using modern techniques used in React and Javascript.


6) I have been able to write unit tests for all of the components in isolation ensuring that they are all already tested when used together
